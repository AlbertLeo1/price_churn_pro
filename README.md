# Smart Outlier Handler

**SmartOutlierHandler**, part of a growing suite of high-performing and flexible pipeline components I'm developing, is a fully automated and customizable transformer for intelligent outlier handling in modern machine learning workflows.

Most pipelines today rely on basic imputation strategies—like replacing missing or extreme values with the global mean or most frequent value. However, these simplistic approaches often fail to capture the true underlying distribution, especially in **multimodal features** with multiple peaks.

## 🔍 Key Features

- **Automatic distribution analysis**, including detection of multimodal features
- **Flexible outlier treatment strategies**, such as:
  - Isolation-based filtering
  - Interquartile Range (IQR)
  - Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
  - Clipping
- **Seamless integration** with `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning

📈 **Tested and trusted to enhance predictive accuracy across diverse datasets.**
